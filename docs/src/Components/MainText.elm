This is really easy... for a human, but our task was to do it with a computer program. We were given a training set of smileys with 4 different emotions.  The computer would after its training then have to guess right on at least 65% of the pictures in the test set.

We then decided to teach the computer how to rotate the images so the darkest part of the image was at the top (that was most often the eyes). It got to about **95%**. We made one last tweek were we separated the computers task into recognizing the eyes and recognizing the mouth and then base our guess on their respective guesses.

After we made that change we ran the test set with 200 images one hundred times and our program guessed right <br/> <span style="font-size:1.6rem"> **one hundred percent of the time** </span>!

voiceText : String
voiceText =
    """One day at school me and my friends started discussing natural design (using metaphors from the real world to make an interaction more seemless for the user) and one of us claimed that voice assistant, such as Google and Siri were in fact NOT natural at all. This was an interesting topic because to me it uses a lot of metaphors from the real world, you are actually talking to it.

Despite our differences in opinion on the classification we could all agree after testing it further that it felt really unnatural. You felt like you had to talk in a certain way and use the right words and so on.

So when it came time to write a big report about design I chose the topic, "The UX of voice assistant" in which I performed some tests on peoples reaction to Siri and Google Assistant and wrote a 15 pages long paper about it.

The results were better than expected, people really seemed to like it but there were two problems that stuck out.

Google Assistant had a habit of interupting people mid-sentence even if it was really clear from context that the person had not stopped talking.

Both assistants biggest fault seems to be that the interaction is very unclear from the users side, they did not know what they could ask and dared not try to see where the boundaries were. The problem seems to lie in that both assistants does not have coverage for enough variations on phrases. In the pictures below you can see a user try to close Siri in two ways, it is not clear for the user why one should work and the other not.

Thanks to everyone who helped me by correcting my report multiple times, writing scientificly is really not my strong suit and you helped me through.
